# 📚 MediMind - Documentation Index

Welcome to the MediMind documentation! This index will help you find exactly what you need.

## ⚠️ FIRST TIME HERE? READ THIS!

**Before anything else, check if you have Flutter installed:**

```powershell
flutter --version
```

- ✅ **If it works**: Great! Skip to [Quick Start](#-quick-start) below
- ❌ **If you get an error**: You need to install Flutter first!
  
  👉 **[START_HERE.md](START_HERE.md)** - Quick prerequisite check  
  👉 **[INSTALL_FLUTTER.md](INSTALL_FLUTTER.md)** - Complete Flutter installation guide

**Why?** This is a Flutter app. Without Flutter SDK, nothing will work. The setup scripts will fail, you can't run the app, and you can't build it.

## 🚀 Quick Start

**New to the project? Start here:**

1. **[START_HERE.md](START_HERE.md)** - First-time prerequisites check (⚡ START HERE IF NEW!)
2. **[PROJECT_SUMMARY.md](PROJECT_SUMMARY.md)** - 5-minute overview of the entire project
3. **[SETUP.md](SETUP.md)** - Step-by-step setup instructions
4. **[QUICKREF.md](QUICKREF.md)** - Quick reference for common commands

**Fastest way to get started (if Flutter already installed):**
```powershell
.\setup.bat
```
